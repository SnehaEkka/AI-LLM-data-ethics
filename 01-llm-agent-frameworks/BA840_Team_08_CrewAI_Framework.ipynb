        "Using Crew AI, we developed a travel itinerary chatbot that effectively planned a budget-friendly week-long trip to Europe for 4 grad students from Boston. Compared to AutoGen, Crew AI's modular and flexible agent design allowed for specialized agents to handle different aspects of the travel planning process, resulting in a comprehensive and accurate itinerary. The chatbot provided detailed plans for Prague, Budapest, Krakow, and Lisbon, offering cultural experiences and budget-friendly options.
