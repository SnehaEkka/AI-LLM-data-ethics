# AI, LLM & Data Ethics 🤖⚖️

This repository explores the ethical, practical, and societal issues involved in developing and deploying AI systems, large language models (LLMs), and data-driven workflows. Through hands-on exercises and reflective analysis, this collection tackles core questions about **fairness, accountability, safety, and impact**, bridging technical rigor with ethical responsibility.

As someone passionate about building scalable, human-centered data systems, I worked through this series of exercises to explore not only *what* we can create with AI, but *how* to do so responsibly.

|--------------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `01-llm-agent-frameworks`| LLM Agent Architectures    | Investigates frameworks for building and deploying LLM-powered agents with considerations around modularity, controllability, and safety. |
| `02-COMPAS-data-fairness`| Algorithmic Fairness       | Examines fairness and bias in real-world datasets like COMPAS, exploring bias detection and mitigation techniques in model outcomes.        |

## 🛠️ Key Skills Demonstrated

- Ethical analysis of AI and large language models  
- Building and evaluating LLM agent design frameworks  
- Detecting and mitigating algorithmic bias in data-driven models  
- Responsible prompt engineering and model usage  
- Integration of ethical considerations into practical AI workflows  
- Data exploration and visualization with Python  

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Prompt engineering with OpenAI GPT-4  
- Jupyter Notebook including detailed narrative and documentation  

## 💡 Why This Matters

As AI technologies increasingly influence decisions and experiences, **ethical fluency is as important as technical skill**. This repository underscores my belief that the most impactful data professionals bake *fairness, transparency, and interpretability* into systems from the start.

Whether designing AI analytics, pipelines, or dialogue systems, I strive to blend strong engineering with ethical foresight. This project is a living demonstration of that commitment—a foundation for more trustworthy, human-aligned innovation.
