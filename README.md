# AI, LLM & Data Ethics 🤖⚖️

This repository explores the ethical, practical, and societal issues involved in developing and deploying AI systems, large language models (LLMs), and data-driven workflows. Through hands-on exercises and reflective analysis, this collection tackles core questions about **fairness, accountability, safety, and impact**, bridging technical rigor with ethical responsibility.

As someone passionate about building scalable, human-centered data systems, I built this series to explore not only *what* we can create with AI, but *how* to do so responsibly.

| `Algorithmic-bias-exploration`| Bias & Fairness      | Simulates algorithmic decision-making to reveal how and where bias can infiltrate models and affect outcomes.     |
| `Ethics-of-LLM-prompts`       | Responsible AI       | Examines the construction and consequences of LLM prompts—including injection attacks, bias, and user control.    |

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Prompt engineering with OpenAI GPT-4
- Jupyter Notebook & detailed narrative analysis

## 💡 Why This Matters

As AI technologies increasingly influence decisions and experiences, **ethical fluency is as important as technical skill**. This repository underscores my belief that the most impactful data professionals bake *fairness, transparency, and interpretability* into systems from the start.

Whether designing AI analytics, pipelines, or dialogue systems, I strive to blend strong engineering with ethical foresight. This project is a living demonstration of that commitment—a foundation for more trustworthy, human-aligned innovation.

👩💻 Created with curiosity, caution, and care. If you also believe responsible AI must be built in, not bolted on, let’s connect.
